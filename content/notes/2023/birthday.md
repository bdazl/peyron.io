# :man_astronaut: :rocket: :fireworks: :earth_africa: :sunny:

Today is my (\\(2^{5}+1\\)):rd birthday. The world celebrates me, I usually tell people, but more accurately:
the world celebrates. If you are reading this, you made it through yet another spin around the :sunny:
I'm grateful to have experienced 2023 and I'm looking forward to what 2024 has to offer.

The earth is (very roughly) [\\( 2^{2^5} \\) years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth),
and such a lovely fact makes me want to try out the \\( \LaTeX \\) capabilities of this site generator:
$$ 2^{2^5} = 2^{32} \approx 4 * 10^9 $$

## Reflecting 2023

These past years has reminded us that we are indeed fragile and some of us are in more need than others. I urge
you to support our extended family, in places where the darkness seems larger than the light. Conjure whatever
beam of luminance you are capable. We must make the utmost effort to protect the vessel :earth_africa:, and
its inhabitants :couple:, that carries us through the darkness.

## Absorbing 2024

On a lighter note, here is a list of things I want to do more of next year:
* Make stuff
  - [Generative](https://github.com/bdazl/goffer) [art](Art)
  - [Programs](https://github.com/bdazl/tmpl)
  - [Website content](https://github.com/bdazl/peyron.io)
  - Music
* Ride more bicycle (hopefully along [GÃ¶ta Canal](https://www.gotakanal.se/en))
* Try not to let perfection get in the way of action

**Happy new year, dear reader :fireworks:**
